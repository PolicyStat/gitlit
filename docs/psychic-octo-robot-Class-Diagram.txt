class UI.FileInterfaceUI {
    This UI would consist of a means for users to 
    add files and commit them to the repository. This
    would also allow users to view the current revision
    of the file, branches, pull the new version. Users
    can also compile the repo into the structured file.
}

class UI.PullRequestUI {
    This UI allows users to view, comment, and 
    approve pull requests for the document.
}

class UI.DiffUI {
    This UI allows for users to view the 
    differences between revisions of a document,
    offering side-by-side diff viewing.
}

class UI.MergeUI {
    This is very similar to the DiffUI, 
    but allows for selection of the version 
    in the diff that is to be used in the merge.
}

class Parsing.Parser {
    Parses the structured document into a 
    format that is usable by the 
    RepoFabricator to create the file 
    directory for the GitRepository.
}

class Parsing.HTMLParser {

}
class Generation.HTMLGenerator {

}

class Parsing.XMLParser {

}
class Generation.XMLGenerator {

}

class "Parsing.OtherParser" <<other format>> {

}
class "Generation.OtherGenerator" <<other format>>{

}

class Generation.Generator{
    Generates the structured document from 
    the file system that is in the repository.
    It uses the structure that is made by 
    RepoFabricator and builds the proper file format.
}

class RepoFabricator{
    Creates the file structure for the Git 
    repository and sets up the metadata files 
    to allow for directories to be constructed 
    into the document.
}

class GitEngine{
    Back end worker for the interaction with 
    Git repositories. Primarily uses js-git
    to make commits, add changes, and pull 
    remote changes.
}
