    <p por-id="f35a737ebbfed7fbe3dcd160">Siemens Reagent Multistix 10SG strips for urinalysis are firm, plastic
      strips to which are affixed several separate reagent areas. The reagent
      strip contains tests for specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones,
      bilirubin, blood, nitrite, urobilinogen and leukocytes in urine. Test results
      may provide information regarding the status of carbohydrate metabolism,
      kidney and liver function, acid-base balance and urinary tract infection.
      The strips are ready to use upon removal from the bottle. Accurate timing
      is essential to provide optimal results.</p>

      the enzyme glucose oxidase to catalyze the formation of gluconic acid and
      hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation of glucose. A second enzyme, peroxidase,
      catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with a potassium iodide chromagen
      to oxidize the chromagen to colors ranging from green to brown.</p>

                fresh urine to obtain optimal results with the tests for urine bilirubin
                and urobilinogen, as these compounds are very unstable when exposed to
