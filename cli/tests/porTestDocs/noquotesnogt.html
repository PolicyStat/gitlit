    
<h4>Policy</h4>
<p>Siemens&#160;Reagent Multistix 10SG strips for urinalysis are firm, plastic strips to which are affixed several separate reagent areas. The reagent strip contains tests for specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, nitrite, urobilinogen and leukocytes in urine. Test results may provide information regarding the status of carbohydrate metabolism, kidney and liver function, acid-base balance and urinary tract infection. The strips are ready to use upon removal from the bottle. Accurate timing is essential to provide optimal results.</p>
<h4>Principle</h4>
<p><strong>Glucose Test</strong>: This test is based on a double sequential enzyme reaction. The reaction utilizes the enzyme glucose oxidase to catalyze the formation of gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide from the oxidation of glucose. A second enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with a potassium iodide chromagen to oxidize the chromagen to colors ranging from green to brown.</p>
<p><strong>Bilirubin Test</strong>: This test is based on the coupling of bilirubin with diazotized dichloroaniline in a strongly acid medium. The color ranges through various shades of tan.</p>
<p><strong>Ketone Test</strong>: This test is based on the development of colors ranging from buff-pink, for a negative reading, to purple when acetoacetic acid reacts with nitroprusside.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Gravity Test</strong>: This test is based on the apparent pKa change of certain pretreated polyelectrolytes in relation to ionic concentration. In the presence of an indicator, colors range from deep blue-green in urines of low ionic concentration through green and yellow-green in urines of increasing ionic concentration.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Test</strong>: This test is based on the peroxidase-like activity of hemoglobin which catalyzes the reaction of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and 3, 3',5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine. The resulting color ranges from orange through green. Very high levels of blood may cause the color development to continue to blue.</p>
<p><strong>pH Test</strong>: This test is based on the double indicator principle which gives a broad range of colors covering the entire urinary pH range Colors range from orange through yellow and green to blue.</p>
<p><strong>Protein Test</strong>: This test is based on the protein-error-of-indicators principle. At a constant buffered pH, the development of any green color is due to the presence of protein. Colors range from yellow for Negative through yellow-green and green to green-blue for Positive reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Urobilinogen Test</strong>: This test area is based on a modified Ehrlich reaction in which p-diethylaminobenzaldehyde in conjunction with a color enhancer reacts with urobilinogen in a strongly acid medium to produce a pink-red color.</p>
<p><strong>Nitrite Test</strong>: This test depends upon the conversion of nitrate (derived from the diet) to nitrite by the action of Gram Negative bacteria in the urine. At the acid pH of the reagent area, nitrite in the urine reacts with p-arsanilic acid to form a diazonium compound. This diazonium compound in turn couples with 1, 2, 3, 4 - tetrahydrobenzo (h) quinolin-3-ol to form a pink color.</p>
<p><strong>Leukocyte Test</strong>: Granulocytic leukocytes contain esterases that catalyze the hydrolysis of the derivatized pyrrole amino acid ester to liberate 3-hydroxy-5-phenyl pyrrole. This pyrrole then reacts with a diazonium salt to produce a purple product.</p>
<h4>Reagents</h4>
<p>At the time of impregnation:</p>

<h4>Storage and Stability</h4>
<p>Multistix strips:<br />Store at temperatures between 15-30°C (59-86°F). Do not store in a refrigerator. Do not use after expiration date.</p>
<p>Hematronix qUAntify Control System<br />Store at 2-8°C. Do not freeze. Allow to reach room temperature prior to testing. Controls are stable until the expiration date stated on the label if stored at proper temperature.</p>
<h4>Reagent Handling</h4>
<p>Do not remove strip from bottle until immediately before it is to be used. Replace cap immediately and tightly after removing reagent strip. Do not touch test areas of the reagent strip. Keep reagent test areas away from detergents that may be found in specimen containers and other contaminating substances found in working areas.&#160;Prevent fingers and other objects from touching the reagent areas before testing. Do not remove desiccants from bottle. Dip test areas in urine completely, but briefly, to avoid dissolving out reagents. Read test results carefully at the times specified in a good light and with the test area held near the appropriate Color Chart on the bottle label. All unused strips must remain in the original bottle. Do not read in direct sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>PROTECTION AGAINST AMBIENT MOISTURE, LIGHT AND HEAT IS MANDATORY TO GUARD AGAINST ALTERED REAGENT REACTIVITY</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Specimen Collection</strong></h4>
<p>Multistix 10SG is designed to be used on any random (spot), freshly voided well-mixed urine specimen, but also may be used on urines collected under special conditions, such as first morning specimens and post-prandial urines. Nitrite results are optimized by using a first morning specimen or one which has been incubated in the bladder for 4 hours or more.</p>
<p>In all situations, the urine should be collected in a clean, dry container and should be tested as soon as possible after collection. The use of urine preservatives is not recommended. It is of particular importance to use fresh urine to obtain optimal results with the tests for urine bilirubin and urobilinogen, as these compounds are very unstable when exposed to room temperature and light. If testing cannot be performed within an hour after voiding, the specimen should be refrigerated immediately and returned to room temperature before testing. Urine, as any biological material, must be handled under strict sanitary conditions. Prolonged exposure of unpreserved urine to room temperature may result in microbial proliferation with resultant changes in pH. A shift to alkaline pH may cause false positive results with the protein test area. Urine containing glucose may decrease in pH as organisms metabolize the glucose.</p>
<p>Bacterial growth from contaminating organisms may cause false positive blood reactions from the peroxidases produced. In random urine specimens from females, a positive result for leukocytes may be due to a source external to the urinary tract</p>
<h4>Quality Control</h4>
<p>Controls should be run&#160;at least once per month and/or when a new bottle of strips is opened.</p>
<p><strong>BioRad qUAntify Control Levels 1 and 2</strong> are to be used for urinalysis quality control testing</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<ol class="list-decimal">
<li>Before sampling, allow the controls to reach room temperature (18 to 25°C) and invert the bottle several times to ensure homogeneity. </li><li>Remove the dropper tip cap.</li><li>Holding the dipstick reagent in one hand, invert the control bottle and apply control material directly across each pad by gently squeezing the bottle.</li><li>Remove excess control by tilting the dipstick on its edge and blotting on an absorbent towel.</li><li>Wipe the tip of the control bottle, recap, and return to the appropriate storage conditions.</li><li>Review results and record on the appropriate log. Determine if results are in range by referring to the package insert.</li><li>If quality control fails, review policy and manufacturer's instructions and&#160;ensure proper technique was followed. Repeat quality control. Patient testing cannot be performed&#160;until quality control is acceptable.</li><li>If quality control continues to fail, contact the Point of Care Coordinator or the manufacturer for troubleshooting information. Patient specimens should be sent to the main laboratory (with proper orders) when point of care testing cannot be performed.</li></ol>
<h4>Calibration</h4>
<p>Calibration and calibration verification is not required for this test. </p>
<h4>Patient Testing Procedure</h4>
<ol class="list-decimal">
<li>Remove one strip from the&#160;bottle and replace cap.</li><li>Completely immerse all reagent areas of the strip in the&#160;urine specimen and remove immediately.</li><li>While removing, run the edge of strip against the rim of urine container to remove excess urine. <strong>Hold strip in a horizontal position to prevent possible mixing of chemicals from adjacent reagent areas and/or soiling of hands with urine</strong>.</li><li>Compare reagent areas to corresponding Color Chart on the bottle label at the time specified. Hold the test strip close to the Color Chart and match carefully.&#160;Avoid laying the strip directly on Color Chart, as this will result in the urine soiling the chart. Proper read time is critical for optimal results. See Results section below for proper read times.</li></ol>

<p>A combined result of glucose 500 mg/dL <strong>and</strong> ketones 40 mg/dL is considered a critical result and must be reported to a registered nurse or physician as soon as possible. Documentation of who was notified, date and time of notification, and who notified the clinician must be documented on the Critical Results Log.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>As with all laboratory tests, definitive diagnostic or therapeutic decisions should not be based on any single result or method. Substances that cause abnormal urine color, such as drugs containing azo dyes, Nitrofurantoin, and Riboflavin, may affect the readability of reagent areas on urinalysis strips. The color development may be masked or a color reaction may be produced that could be interpreted as a false positive.</p>
<p><strong>Glucose</strong>: Ketone bodies reduce the sensitivity of the test; moderately high ketone levels (40mg/dL) may cause false negatives for specimens containing small amounts of glucose (75-125 mg/dL) but the combination of such ketone levels and low glucose levels is metabolically improbable in screening. <br /><strong>Bilirubin</strong>:&#160;Indocan (indoxyl sulfate) can produce a yellow-orange to red color response that may interfere with the interpretation of a negative or positive reading. Metabolites of Lodine (etodolac) may cause false positives or atypical results.&#160;Atypical colors (colors that are unlike the negative or positive color blocks shown on the color chart) may indicate&#160;that bilirubin-derived bile pigments are present in the urine sample and may be masking the&#160;bilirubin reaction. These colors may indicate bile pigment abnormalities and the urine specimen&#160;should be tested further (e.g. ICTOTEST reagent tablets).&#160;<br /><strong>Ketone</strong>:False&#160;trace results may occur with highly pigmented urine specimens or those containing large amounts of levadopa metabolites. Compounds such as mesna (2-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid)&#160;that contain sulfhydryl groups may cause false positive results or an atypical reaction.<br /><strong>Specific Gravity</strong>: The Siemens SG test is dependent&#160;on ions in urine and results may differ from those obtained with other specific gravity methods when certain nonionic urine constituents, such as glucose, are present. Highly buffered alkaline urine may cause low readings, while the presence of moderate quantities of protein (100-750 mg/dL) may cause elevated readings.<br /><strong>Blood</strong>: Capoten (Captopril) may also cause decreased reactivity. Certain oxidizing contaminants, such as hypochlorite, may produce false positive results. Microbial peroxidase associated with urinary tract infection may cause a false positive reaction. <br /><strong>pH</strong>:&#160;Bacterial growth by certain organisms in a specimen may cause a marked alkaline shift (pH  8.0) usually because of urea conversion to ammonia. <br /><strong>Protein</strong>: The protein test pad is not specific for a particular protein, and proteins other than albumin can cause a positive response. The test is less sensitive to mucoproteins and globulins, which are generally detected at levels of 60 mg/dL or higher).<br /><strong>Urobilinogen</strong>: The test pad&#160;may react with interfering substances known to react with Ehrlich's reagent, such as <em>p</em>-aminosalicylic acid and sulfonamides. Atypical color reactions may be obtained in the presence of high concentrations of <em>p</em>-aminobenzoic acid. False negative results may be obtained if formalin is present. Strip reactivity increases with temperature; optimal temperature is 22-26°C. The test is not a reliable method for the detection of porphobilinogen.<br /><strong>Nitrite</strong>: Pink spots or pink edges should not be interpreted as a positive result.&#160;A negative result does not in rule out significant bacteriuria. False negative results may occur with shortened bladder incubation of the urine, absence of dietary nitrate, or the presence of nonreductive pathological microbes.<br /><strong>Leukocytes</strong>: Elevated glucose concentrations (≥ 3 g/dL) may cause decreased test result. The presence of cephalexin (keflex), cephalothin (keflin) or high concentrations of oxalic acid may also cause decreased test results. Tetracycline may cause decreased reactivity and high levels of the drug may cause a false negative reaction. Positive results may occasionally be due to contamination of the specimen by vaginal discharge.</p>
